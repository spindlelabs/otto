Otto
====

*For an introduction to Otto, read our blog post: [Otto: unifying deployment, application management, and platform management](https://github.com/spindlelabs/otto/blob/master/docs/20130517-hello-otto.md)*

Otto is tested with Puppet 2.7.19 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Getting started: deploying `helloworld`
---------------------------------------

`helloworld` is a simple Java application that reads its configuration, logs several messages, and then exits after 30 seconds (simulating an application crash.) We'll demonstrate deploying `helloworld` from a build server using Otto. (Otto is agnostic to how your artifact lands on the machine; you could use [BitTorrent](http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/04/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-facebook-release-engineering/), for example.)

To deploy `helloworld`, Otto will:

1. Create an unprivileged user, `helloworld` (`examples/helloworld/modules/helloworld/manifests/init.pp`)
2. Install the Java 7 runtime package, `openjdk-7-jre` (`examples/helloworld/modules/java/manifests/init.pp`)
3. Create the `/opt/otto` hierarchy (`modules/otto/manifests/init.pp`)
4. Install [`daemontools`](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html), a [public domain](http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html) collection of tools for managing services
5. Ensure that [`svscan`](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/svscan.html), the `daemontools` service scanner, is running
6. Download the `helloworld` build artifact from the (simulated, Jenkins-like) build server into `/opt/otto/build/helloworld/helloworld-master-checkin@1` (`examples/helloworld/modules/otto_java_app_from_jenkins/manifests/init.pp`)
7. Deploy the `helloworld` configuration files into `/opt/otto/conf/helloworld` (`examples/helloworld/files/conf`)
8. Run the application using `/opt/otto/run/helloworld` (`examples/helloworld/templates/run.erb`)
9. Ensure that the service is [started at boot and automatically restarted if it fails](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/faq/create.html#why)

To deploy `helloworld` on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, run:

    sudo apt-get install git puppet
    git clone https://github.com/spindlelabs/otto.git
    cd otto

    # This command will make changes to your system state as described above; consider using a virtual machine
    sudo puppet apply --modulepath modules:examples/helloworld/modules --debug examples/helloworld/manifests/site.pp

`helloworld` will be installed into `/opt/otto` and started automatically.

Try a few experiments (as `root`) to understand Otto:

* Run [`svstat /etc/service/helloworld`](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/svstat.html) to show the application's PID and uptime
* Run `pstree -paul` to show the process hierarchy; observe that `java` is running as the unprivileged `helloworld` user
* Run [`svc -t /etc/service/helloworld`](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/svc.html) to send `SIGTERM` to the application; it will automatically restart
* Restart the machine; `helloworld` will automatically start
* View the application logs in `/opt/otto/data/helloworld/log`. Observe the logged configuration values and environment variables.
* Examine `/opt/otto/service/helloworld/run` and `/opt/otto/run/helloworld` to understand how Otto invokes `helloworld`. Note that the logging configuration in `/opt/otto/conf/helloworld/logback.xml` uses an environment variable supplied by Otto to locate the application data directory without hard-coding paths.
* Note the permissions for `/opt/otto/build/helloworld/helloworld-master-checkin@1`, `/opt/otto/conf/helloworld`, and `/opt/otto/data/helloworld`: an application can modify its data directory but cannot modify its build artifact or its configuration

Next, try changing the application configuration. After making each change below, rerun the `puppet apply` command above; Otto will restart the application with its new configuration.

* Deploy a different build (`1`, `2` or `3`) by changing `jenkinsBuildID` in `examples/helloworld/manifests/site.pp`. Otto will download the new build, stop the existing build, and then start the new build. Try rolling back to a previous build; Otto will avoid redownloading a build that it has already retrieved. Because the build is configured using the Puppet DSL, you can use features like [`generate()`](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/function.html#generate), [`extlookup()`](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/function.html#extlookup), and [external node classifiers](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/external_nodes.html) to dynamically determine the build running on each node. You could use these features to implement continuous deployment, scheduled deployment ("deploy this build when traffic drops below `k` QPS"), or automatic rollback.
* Change the log level in `examples/helloworld/modules/helloworld/files/conf/logback.xml` or the configuration value `value1` in `examples/helloworld/modules/files/conf/application.conf`
* Change the configuration value `value2` in `examples/helloworld/manifests/site.pp`
* Change `appRunService` to `false` in `examples/helloworld/manifests/site.pp` to stop the application; ensure that the change persists after restarting the machine. Revert the change to continue experimenting.
* Change the configuration value `value3` in `examples/helloworld/modules/templates/run.erb` by changing the amount of swap space on the machine (`dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=65536; mkswap /swapfile; swapon /swapfile`). The amount of swap space on the machine is provided by [Facter](http://puppetlabs.com/blog/facter-part-1-facter-101/).
* As `root`, modify `/opt/otto/conf/helloworld/logback.xml`. Otto will revert the change to prevent configuration drift.
* Simulate a build server failure by changing `jenkinsBuildID` in `examples/helloworld/manifests/site.pp` and `appBuildArtifactUrl` in `examples/helloworld/modules/otto_java_app_from_jenkins/manifests/init.pp`. Otto will abort the upgrade, log an error, and continue running the previous build. Otto will retry the upgrade the next time Puppet runs.

Next steps
----------

Now that you've seen a working example, try deploying your own application with Otto. If you're not familiar with Puppet, read the [Puppet introduction](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/introduction.html). Copy `modules/otto` into your Puppet modules directory, and modify the examples to fit your environment. Be sure to follow the application notes in `modules/otto/manifests/{app,init}.pp`.

Known issues
------------

* Otto does not provide a mechanism for removing deployed applications, but it's easy to do manually: remove the application definition from the node manifest, [stop the application and its `supervise` process](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/faq/create.html#remove), and then remove its state from `/opt/otto`. You could also simply set `appRunService` to `false`.
